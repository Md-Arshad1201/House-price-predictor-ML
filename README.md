# 🏡 House Price Predictor using Machine Learning  

📌 A Machine Learning project that predicts house prices based on various features like **location, area, and number of rooms**.  
It uses **Random Forest Regression** to provide accurate price estimations, and the trained model is saved in `Dragon.joblib` for reuse.

## 🚀 How to Train the Model  

1️⃣ **Open Jupyter Notebook**  
2️⃣ **Run `Dragon Real Estates.ipynb`**  
   - The trained model will be saved as **`Dragon.joblib`**  

---

## 🎯 How to Use the Trained Model  

Once the model is trained, you can **load and use it** in **`Model Usage.ipynb`** or a Python script.  

## 🤔 What Does RandomForestRegressor() Indicate?

When we print the loaded model, it shows:

**RandomForestRegressor()**

This output indicates that:

✅ **The model is a Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble learning method.**
✅ **It consists of multiple decision trees trained on different parts of the dataset.**
✅ **It averages predictions from all trees, reducing overfitting and improving accuracy.**

## 🔍 Making Predictions

Now that we have loaded our trained model, we can make predictions on new data.
