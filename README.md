# 🏡 **House Price Predictor using Machine Learning**  

📌 A **Machine Learning** project that predicts **house prices** based on various features like **location**, **area**, and **number of rooms**.  
It uses **Random Forest Regression** to provide **accurate price estimations**, and the trained model is saved in **`Dragon.joblib`** for reuse.
